* I've stared a new recode project on this software. Right now everything is getting bug free. SQL Notpad is understanding both apostrophe and backslash escaped apostrophes. When the software is finished I will merge the new file with the old one and clean up here. 

Sep 10th, 2025

* Added numerator to the set field tool.
* Added about modal.
* Updated help modal-last line now explains Copy Board better.

Sep 4th, 2025

* Added a paste feature for type of 'horizontal field dumping.'
* Debugging changed, but shoddy and errenous. Probably give up on this until a new GPT model or human editor comes along.
* Software stumbles most when features encounter an escaped apostrophe. Just do these tuples by hand, and keep a close eye on work.

Sep 4th, 2025

* Added Ctrl+K hoykey - coppies current field across tuples in set.
* Update Template Maker - now both methods are working.
* Debugged Debugger a bit - still working like garbage, shoddy debugging, with errors.

Sep 3rd, 2025

* Extended template maker to have a one per line method to maintain commas in field values. Copy Board takes csv lists.

Sep 3rd, 2025

* Created new tool at Tools -> Template Maker. Template maker will turn the set of rows in the document into a working template. Every item in the Copy Board will become a new copy with Copy Board item at n'th field. The finished sets will be appended to the document.
* Totally broke debugging. Not sure if repair is coming any time soon.

Aug 29th, 2025

* Added new tool. Tools -> Field -> Append/Prepend. Append prepend field to field or string to field.
* Initially wrong about error handling. It will catch three errors and zero warnings. Will find missmatched field count, missing end token, and a poorly escaped apostrophe using '/.' Field count uses a sample, so the error may be elsewhere. End field may be blank, not intending a token.
* Removed Crtl+Shift+E from launching Debugging window. Now launched by Ctrl+Shift+U.

Aug 28th, 2025

* Updated swapper a bit. Still has problems. May need to re-swap.
* Added Debugger to find improperly escaped apostrophes which stumbles the tools.

Aug 26th, 2025

* Fixed bug in swapper. Now using session storage for field names.
* Added field swapper in Tools -> Field -> Swapper. Can name fields and jumble them into a new order.

Notes - More edits to come. Lost phone from hood drive. Will be back in full swing within a week or two.

Aug 23rd, 2025

* Fixed Clear Copyboard bug in menu.
* Fixed Ctrl+S writing mode - hide menu writing mode works again.
* Add List Extractor - Create a CSV list of x field from doc or x set.
* Set # Pill - Introduced a set # output at the top.

Aug 22nd, 2025

* Added a menu.
* Added a new set field popup found inside menu.

(List Extractor, About) coming soon.

Aug 21st, 2025

* Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y manipulate a 10 keystroke undo and redo system.
* Ctrl+S enters a clutter-free type mode.
* Ctrl+Shift+E opens duplicate token report window.
* Fixed cluttered text on remove n'th field button.

Aug 20th, 2025

* Added add field button, understanding numerical or string field.
* Row count output now shows rows in current selected set of tuples.
* Theme is now controlled through settings only.
* Added a token style and length option in the settings.
* Math can now be applied to a set of tuples or the entire document.
* Tokenizer has setting to replace all end tokens on tokenize, or only currently blank fields.
* ctrl+g will generate a random unique token at caret location.
