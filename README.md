**How To Run SQL Notepad**<br>
SQL Notepad is written in HTML5 and JS. Simply save the code in an HTML document and launch it in your preferred browser.


**SQL Notepad**<br>
SQL Notepad came from text game development and working with SQL files over a long period of time. Some of these operations that once took hours will now take minutes.

**Field Dump**<br>

Field dump will take a comma seperated list and dump it vertically into the field located at the caret position.
*'weapons, smithing, spellcraft'* can be dumped into that second field. Highlight the list and add it to the Copy Board with Ctrl+B. Put the caret in the second field of the first tuple and press Ctrl+I to insert the list.

(1, ''),<br>
(2, ''),<br>
(3, ''),<br>

(1, 'weapons'),<br>
(2, 'smithing'),<br>
(3, 'spellcraft'),<br>
